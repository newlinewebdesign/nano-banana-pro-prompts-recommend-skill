## Architecture

Following [Claude Code skill best practices](https://github.com/anthropics/skills):

- **Progressive Disclosure** — Only `featured.json` fully loaded; others searched via Grep
- **Signal Mapping** — Keyword-to-category routing for efficient search
- **Token Optimization** — Never loads full category files into context
