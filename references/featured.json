She holds up a huge puzzle piece (top-left piece, with the number \"20\" on it) with both hands, moving it towards the center of the frame. Her eyes are focused on the central puzzle area, her expression is serious, with a slight smile. The background features navy stripes, an anchor, and the text \"Set Sail for the New Year\". Top-right panel (Cherry Blossom Pink background): The same woman wears a pink lace dress, a pearl necklace, a princess hairstyle with a pink rose hairpin and crystal earrings. She holds up the top-right puzzle piece (with the number \"26\" on it) with both hands, moving it towards the center to connect with the top-left piece. Her eyes look at the puzzle seam, her expression is focused and expectant, and her body leans forward.

Bottom-right panel (Lemon Yellow background): The same woman wears a yellow dress with a sunflower pattern, pigtails with yellow bows. She pushes in the last bottom-right puzzle piece (with the text \"Happy\" on it) to complete the puzzle. The four pieces perfectly form the complete pattern \"2026 New Year's Day Happy\" in the center of the frame. She tilts her head back, looking at the completed puzzle, her face beaming with a successful, joyful smile. The center of the frame bursts with golden light and confetti. The background features a yellow sun, the text \"Complete Success\", smiley faces, and sunflowers. The puzzle pieces converge from the four corners to the center to form a complete picture.
